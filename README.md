# user-directory-meteor
This is another app I am developing to learn how to use Meteor.

## Objective
Create an application that displays a list of users with the ability to load more users

## Challenges
- Need a place to store data
- Need a way to generate this data
- Must assume that we have thousands of entries and we only want to send a small subset to the client at any time.
- Need a way to load more data when the user clicks the 'Load More' button
